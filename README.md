# smart-eye
smart-eye is an app, where you have your basic user authentication using bcrypt-nodejs.
Afterwards, each user is called upon pasting an image url featuring a face and the app detects the face in the image using the Clarifai API.(https://www.clarifai.com/models/face-detection-image-recognition-model-a403429f2ddf4b49b307e318f00e528b-detection)
In addition, for each face that is succesfully detected your user's count is increased by one point!

Check more technical info in the package.json file.

Enjoy!
